# stenograph

Do you ever feel like Edward Scissorhands? With dainty, Paganini-like fingers that you know have the power to move the world with every word flowing from your fingertips? Do you feel as though you can never stop the outpouring of verse, and thus feel the need to procure a suitable speed-typing device to help you spill it all onto paper? Well, do I have good news for you!

We decided to make a heart-shaped stenograph. Now, each chord—every word—will will ring as vibrantly as a guitar with our custom-designed, heart-shaped case. Suitable for writing long letters to your loved ones, or cringey—nay, impassioned—poetry for your unsuspecting crush, the Heartograph is the solution for you!
